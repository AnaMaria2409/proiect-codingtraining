            Write the CSS needed to add the look and interaction found here. I'm giving you the HTML below. You can add classes and id's to the elements, if you feel the need, but otherwise don't modify the structure.
            There's also a little JavaScript there which adds the is--open class to the div class="menu" element when you click the button. It also removes this class if you press the Esc key. So when this class is present show the menu, otherwise it should be hidden.
            PS: don't worry about the JS code, it's ok if you don't understand it.
            PPS: you will need to use CSS transitions for the menu. Also flex would work wonders for the header.

             Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
